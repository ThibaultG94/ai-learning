## How to Use This Module

### Learning Path

1. Read the lesson content in `lessons/`
2. Complete the exercises in `exercises/`
3. Check solutions and experiment
4. Take notes and document challenges
5. Review and practice regularly

### Exercise Structure

Each exercise folder contains:

- `README.md` with instructions
- `exercise.py` starter file
- `solution.py` (hidden until completion)
- `test.py` for testing your solution

### Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Use meaningful variable names
- Comment your code appropriately
- Keep functions and classes focused
- Write docstrings for functions and classes
